# My portfolio

This project contains the source code for my portfolio, designed to be hosted on any server compatible with PHP and Apache (or equivalent).

The website features dynamic content localization, enabling seamless transitions between multiple languages, such as English and French. Its modular and scalable architecture ensures easy maintenance and extensibility. The development stack includes HTML and CSS for visual rendering, JavaScript for client-side interactions, and PHP for server-side logic.

Key features include dynamic language loading, adaptive theme integration (light/dark mode), social media meta tag optimization, secure forms with reCAPTCHA v2, and a structured architecture for efficiently managing both static and dynamic content.

Dimensions:
- Square format: 1024 x 1024 pixels. All composition and layout decisions must assume a square canvas.

Style:  
- Futuristic, tech-oriented, clean and minimal, with a slightly academic vibe

Layout Constraint:
- All key visual elements (icons, diagrams, overlays, text, symbolic objects) must fit within the shape of an uppercase "T", centered inside the square image.  
  - This means:
    - A vertical strip ~400px wide down the center
    - A horizontal band ~300px tall along the top
  - The "T" layout should guide composition only — no visible borders, frames, or indicators of the T shape.  
  - Important: all key content must be clearly visible inside the "T" zone, as areas outside may be cropped in thumbnails or previews.

Elements to include (within the "T" zone):
- A stylized globe made of interconnected nodes and lines to symbolize multilingual global reach and content localization
- Floating tabs showcasing light/dark mode toggles, language names (e.g., English and Français), and browser preview windows
- HTML code snippets subtly integrated into thin flowing lines or behind-glass panels

- A small reCAPTCHA v2 shield icon
- Modular block diagrams to represent scalable architecture

Background:
- A dark theme with subtle blue and red ambient tones fading from the edges
- Fine grid pattern and ghostly circuit lines across the entire canvas

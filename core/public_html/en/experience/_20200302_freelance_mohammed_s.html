  <ul>
    <li>
      Designed a zero-day attack detection system by combining two methods:
      a signature-based intrusion detection system (SIDS) and an anomaly-based
      intrusion detection system (AIDS), significantly enhancing threat
      identification and response capabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
      Adapted a decision tree model for the signature-based
      detection component (SIDS).
    </li>
    <li>
       Adapted a support vector machine (SVM) for the anomaly-based
       detection component (AIDS).
    </li>
    <li>
      Utilized Python, bayesian-optimization, scikit-learn, numpy, pandas,
      matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis, processing, model training,
      and evaluation.
    </li>
